<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> If you installed Pydio by the linux repository ( apt / yum ), you must install the "pydio-plugin-access.mysql" package</p>
<p>Use Pydio as a MySQL database browser like phpMyAdmin. Quite usefull for webmasters. Some very precise operations are not implemented, it's not as complete as phpMyAdmin, but really the standard daily operations on tables and their records are working good.</p>
