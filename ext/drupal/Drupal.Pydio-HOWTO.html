<p>This is the bridge between a Drupal installation and a Pydio. The aim is to provide a single-sign-on (SSO) mechanism based on
the Drupal users system : users logged in Drupal will have access to workspaces of Pydio. <br></p><p><strong><em>It's never totally evident to
interface two different softwares, so don't expect it to be magical,
and please follow the steps carefully and in this order.</em></strong></p>
<h3>1/ Base Installation</h3>

<p>First of
all, make sure you have a Pydio recent version installed, and Drupal 6.x or
7.x<br>Unpack the
Drupal <span style="font-weight: bold;">user.pydio.zip</span> inside the [drupal 6]"<em>sites/all/modules/</em>"
or [drupal 7]"<i>modules/</i>" folder of your Drupal installation.</p>
<h3>2/ Pydio configuration</h3>
<p><strong>2.1 Administrator &amp; guest</strong><br></p><p>If it's not already
done, with the standard pydio authentication mechanism, be sure
that at least an "admin" user is created.</p><p>If you intend to allow
guest browsing, set the "Allow Guest Browsing" option to
true in the Pydio Settings &gt; Global Options &gt; Core Options &gt; Authentication,  and if you are logged, log out. This should create the
"guest" user. As admin, log back to the interface and
create a "Guest" Repository. Go to the users section and
grant access (read only may be better) to this repository to the
"guest" user. Now, when you log out, you should have access
to this repository.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Workspaces</strong><br></p><p>Now create one or many workspaces that you will want your Drupal logged users to access.
You can use the AJXP_USER keyword inside the repository PATH if you
want to create automatically "personal" folders for each
users. Considering the acces rights, the trick here would be to set a "Default Right" value to "rw", so that you don't have to
manually edit the users rights each time you add them.</p>

<p><strong>2.4 Auth.remote configuration</strong></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Logged as admin, go to </span>Settings &gt; Global Options &gt; Core Options &gt; Authentication,<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">and set the
Authentication "Main Instance" driver to be the "Remote Authentication" ( = auth.remote plugin)</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> :<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br></span></span></p><ul><li>Choose the CMS Type "Drupal"</li><li>Enter your Drupal installation full URL (e.g. http://domain.tld/drupal)</li><li>Leave the Login URL to default "/" , except if no login form can be found on your drupal home page.</li><li>Leave the Auth Form ID to default "user-login-form", except if the login form on your drupal home page has not as html ID this string. You can check that using the HTML inspector of your favorite browser.</li><li>Exit Action: either leads back to drupal page, or triggers a log out.</li><li>Local Prefix: force some users with specific prefix to be stored and authenticated locally (not against drupal).</li><li>Secret Key: this will be a string that both side (pydio &amp; drupal) will share to recognize each other</li><li>Login Redirect: if set to a given page URL, when arriving on pydio, a not-logged guest will be directly redirected to this page.</li><li>Admin Login: make sure a specific user will be recognized as administrator by Pydio.<br></li></ul>
<p>Other options should be left to default values, otherwise put your mouse on the options label to get more info. For the secret key, warning, if you want to use a "$" sign in
your key, you have to put a \ before.</p><p>Also make sure NOT to set a secondary instance, this plugin does not support multi-auth configuration yet.<br></p>

<h3>3/ Drupal Configuration</h3>
<p><strong>3.1 Activate Module</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Login to Drupal as
administrator and go to [6]"Administer &gt; Site Building &gt;
Modules"  or [7]"Modules". Here you can select the
"Pydio Bridge" module under the "Other"
section. Enable the plugin.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Configure the module</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Go to "Site
Configuration &gt; Pydio Settings" (click on the module
"Help" for v7). There are three parameters to configure for
this plugin :&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong>Pydio Install Path</strong>
	: here you have to enter the full path to the Pydio
	installation. "Full path" in the sense of the server
	filesystem. On Windows, it could be
	C:/Programs/ApacheData/html/pydio, or Linux more probably
	/var/www/html/Pydio. In any cases, use "slashes" and
	not backslashes, and take care that names are case sensitive. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong>Secret Key</strong> : here
	you'll have to enter the "SECRET" you entered in the Pydio authentication configuration. Warning, if they differ, it
	will (silently) not work. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p><strong>Auto Create Users</strong> : This option is useful
	specially if you are installing this "bridge" when already
	managing many users in a Drupal installation. By default ("no"),
	Users will be created in Pydio only by a Drupal administrator
	action of creating a Drupal users. Existing users will not be
	recognized by Pydio. If you set to "Auto create",
	existing users will be automatically created when a user logs in to
	Drupal. 
	</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Save the module configuration.</p>
<h3><strong>4/ Use!</strong></h3><p><strong></strong>Now everything should be connected,
and you can try the following : create an Administrator user and a
simple user in Drupal. Log in to Drupal as these user and check that
you are recognized in Pydio, and further more, that the
administrator has Pydio administration rights. If you want to
enable the guest mechanism in Pydio, log out from Drupal and
check that you are recognized as "guest" in Pydio.</p><p>If you have not enabled the automatic redirection, check that you can log in from Pydio using drupal users's credenatials. This is important to check, as it will allow the mobile devices to connect successfully as well.</p><p><br></p>
