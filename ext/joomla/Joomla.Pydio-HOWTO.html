This is the bridge between a Joomla installation and an Pydio. The aim
is to provide a single-signon mechanism based on the Joomla users
system : users logged in joomla must have access to repositories of
Pydio. <strong><em>It's
never totally evident to interface two different softwares, so don't
expect it to be magical, and please follow the steps carefully and in
this order.</em></strong></p>
		<h3>
			1/ Base Installation</h3>
		
		<p>
			<strong></strong>First of all, make sure you have a Pydio recent version installed and Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.5 or 3.0<strong></strong><br>
			Drop the right plugin version inside your Joomla installation folder (the "<em>tmp</em>" folder of your Joomla installation.)</p>
		<h3>
			2/ Pydio configuration</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>2.1 Administrator &amp; guest</strong><br>
			</p>
<p>If it's not already done, with the standard Pydio authentication mechanism, be sure that at least an "admin" user is created.</p>

		<p>
			<strong></strong>If you intend to allow guest browsing, set
the "Allow Guest Browsing" option to
true in the Settings &gt; Global Options &gt; Core Options &gt;
Authentication, and if you are logged, log out. This should create the
"guest" user. As admin, log back to the interface and create a "Guest"
Repository. Go to the users section and grant access (read only may be
better) to this repository to the "guest" user. Now, when you log out,
you should have access to this repository.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2.2 Workspaces</strong><br></p>
<p> Now create one or many repositories that you will want your joomla
logged users to access. You can use the AJXP_USER keyword inside the
repository PATH if you want to create automatically "personnal" folders
for each users. Considering the acces rights, the trick here would be
to set a "Default Rights" value to "rw", so that you don't have to
manually edit the users rights each time you add them.</p>

		
		<p>
			<strong>2.3 Auth.remote configuration</strong><br>
			<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"></span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">Go to </span>Settings &gt; Global Options &gt; Core Options &gt; Authentication<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"> and set the "Main Instance" driver to be the <strong>auth.remote</strong>
(Remote Authentication). There is a commented sample in the config file
aimed at Joomla user, you should use the following values :</span></p>

		
		
<ul>
<li>Choose the CMS Type "Joomla"</li><li>Enter your Drupal installation full URL (e.g. http://domain.tld/joomla)</li><li>Leave the Home node to default "/" , except if this page does not contain any login form by default<br>
</li><li>Leave the Auth Form ID to default "user-login-form", except if the
login form on your drupal home page has not as html ID this string. You
can check that using the HTML inspector of your favorite browser.</li>
  <li>Exit Action: either leads back to drupal page, or triggers a log out.</li>
<li>Local Prefix: force some users with specific prefix to be stored and authenticated locally (not against drupal).</li><li>Secret Key: this will be a string that both side (pydio &amp; drupal) will share to recognize each other</li><li>Login Redirect: if set to a given page URL, when arriving on pydio, a not-logged guest will be directly redirected to this page.</li><li>Admin Login: make sure a specific user will be recognized as administrator by Pydio.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other options should be left to default values, otherwise put your
mouse on the options label to get more info. For the secret key,warning, if you want to use a "$" sign in
your key, you have to put a \ before. </p>

<p>Also make sure NOT to set a secondary instance, this plugin does not support multi-auth configuration yet.</p>

		
		<h3>
			3/ Joomla Configuration</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>3.1 Install Extension</strong><br>
			</p>
<p>Login to Joomla adminstration front-end and go to "Extensions &gt;
Install/Uninstall". Normally, the "Install from a folder" section
should be already filled with your "tmp" folder path. Click "Install"
beside this field. It should install successfully the User - Pydio
plugin.</p>

		<p>
			<strong>3.2 Activate and Configure the new plugin</strong><br>
			</p>
<p>Go to "Extension &gt; Manage Plugins" and find the User - Pydio
plugin module in the list. You can select the plugin type "user" to
filter the list. Click in the "Active" column to activate this plugin,
then enter the plugin configuration. Change the "Order" parameter to
make sure this plugin is called AFTER your master authentication
plugin, generally user.joomla. Then there are three ajxp-parameters to
configure for this plugin :&nbsp;</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Pydio Install Path</strong> : here you have
to enter the full path to the Pydio installation. "Full path" in the
sense of the server filesystem. On Windows, it could be
C:/Programs/ApacheData/html/ajaxplorer, or Linux more probably
/var/www/html/Pydio. In any cases, use "slashes" and not backslashes,
and take care that names are case sensitive.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Secret Key</strong>
: here you'll have to enter the "SECRET" you entered in the Pydio
configuration. If it's not the same, it will (silently) not work.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Auto Create Users</strong>
: This option is useful specially if you are installing this "bridge"
when already managing many users in a Joomla installation. By default
("no"), Users will be created in Pydio only by a joomla administrator
action of creating a Joomla users. Existing users will not be
recognized by Pydio. If you set to "Auto create", existing users will
be automatically created when a user logs in to Joomla.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Save the module configuration.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3.3 Use!</strong><br>
Now everything should be connected, and you can try the following :
create an Administrator user and a simple user in Joomla. Log in to
Joomla as these user and check that you are recognized in Pydio, and
further more, that the administrator has Pydio administration rights.
If you want to enable the guest mechanism in Pydio, log out from Joomla
and check that you are recognized as "guest" in Pydio.</p>
