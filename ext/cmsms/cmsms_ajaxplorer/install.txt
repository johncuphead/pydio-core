This CMS Made Simple module will make a bridge between your FEU users and the AjaXplorer users.
That means that users created/deleted in your CMSMS installation will be recognized in your ajaxplorer installation (because ajaxplorer accesses to the FEU users table),
and that you will use the FEU login page instead of the "popup" to log on to AjaXplorer.

This is still an experimental release and has been tested only on a few CMSMS & ajxp versions.

So what do you need to make it work?

 * You must use at least the 3.0 version of AjaXplorer.

 * Extract the FEUajaxplorer folder inside your cmsms/modules/ folder.
or
 * Extract the ajaxplorer xml file and import it in the module manager.

 * Read the help of the module.
 * Activate auth.cmsms in ajaxplorer (see class.cmsmsAuthDriver.php in /plugin/auth.cmsms)
